Welcome to the documentation site for `glitch-soc`!
`glitch-soc` is a friendly [fork][] of the open-source social media software [Mastodon][], with the aim of providing additional features at the risk of potentially less stable software.
You can browse our source code and contribute to the project [on Github][glitch-soc].

###  What's different?

`glitch-soc` adds a number of experimental features to Mastodon, such as:

- [Media improvements](./features/media/)<br>
  - Images inside the CW spoiler
  - fullwidth images
  - scaling options
- [An app settings modal](./features/app-settings/)
- [Collapsible toots](./features/collapsible-toots/)
- [Toot visibility icons](./features/visibility-icons/)
- [Local-only toots](./features/local-only-toots/)
- [Threaded mode](./features/threaded-mode/)
- [`data-*` attributes on statuses](./features/status-data-attributes/) for custom CSS targeting
- [Advanced theming via flavours+skins](./features/themes/)
- [Bookmarks](./features/bookmarks/)
- [Doodle](./features/doodle/)

### Features that have made their way upstream

Some of the features originally implemented in glitch-soc have been adopted in
Mastodon:

- [Optional boost hiding](./upstreamed-features/optional-boost-hiding/)
- [Optional notification muting](./upstreamed-features/optional-notification-muting/)
- [Custom profile metadata](./upstreamed-features/profile-metadata/)

### How to install and update `glitch-soc`?

`glitch-soc` is based on Mastodon's master branch. The installation steps are thus
the same as [described in the Mastodon documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/administration/installation/).

Updating from Mastodon (or from an earlier `glitch-soc` version) is exactly like updating from one Mastodon version
to another, and will in general require the following steps:

0. Switch to glitch-soc, for instance by:
    - adding a new remote `git remote add glitch-soc https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon`
    - fetching it (`git fetch glitch-soc`)
    - switching to the `master` branch from that repo (`git checkout glitch-soc/master`)   
1. Fetch the source code (typically, `git pull`)
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install && yarn install`
3. Run the pre-deployment database migrations: `RAILS_ENV=production SKIP_POST_DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATIONS=true bundle exec rails db:migrate`
4. Pre-compile static assets: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile`

   Due to glitch-soc shipping with two front-end flavours, this step requires more resources than it does on mainline Mastodon.
5. Restart the services: `systemctl reload mastodon-web && systemctl restart mastodon-{sidekiq,streaming}`
6. Clean Rails' cache: `RAILS_ENV=production bin/tootctl cache clear`
7. Run the post-deployment database migrations: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate`
