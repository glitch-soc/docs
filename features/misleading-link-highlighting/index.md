title: Misleading links highlighting
---

By default, `glitch-soc` will display the target domain of any link that does not
unambiguously start with it, in order to avoid misleading links such as spoofing
attempts.

![highlighted misleading link](./misleading-link.png)

This behavior can be disabled from the [app settings](../app-settings).
